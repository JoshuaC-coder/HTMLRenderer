# HTML Rendering Program

## Objective

Render a simple HTML file using GUI tools by leveraging work with file I/O, string manipulation, and logic. This project builds on an existing HTML tokenizer and extends it to visually display HTML content in a simulated browser window.

## Features

- Handles rendering of standard HTML tags like `<p>`, `<b>`, `<i>`, `<br>`, `<hr>`, and all six header levels.
- Recognizes nested HTML tags and applies appropriate formatting.
- Enforces max line lengths per tag type (e.g., 80 chars for normal text, 60 for `<h3>`, etc.).
- Preserves line breaks and formatting for `<pre>` tags.
- Treats HTML tags as case-insensitive.
